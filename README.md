## Our Data Pipeline Project

This repository consists of a Data Pipeline Project that loads raw data using Fivetran and uses a Python script to load Weatherstack API data and uses dbt to transform raw data sources loaded using Fivetran and Python script into clear, formatted models for Analytics.

### Sources:
Raw, unformatted data loaded directly from source systems using various data tools.

- **`nba_data`** – The primary source of NBA statistics data captured from a hosted gcp postgres server and loaded via Fivetran.
  - Database: `raw`, Schema: `gcp_postgres_nba_data`

- **`google_sheets`** – Internally maintained reference sheets related to the project, loaded via Fivetran.
  - Database: `raw`, Schema: `gsheets`

- **External API Data** – Additional datasets loaded via Python scripts as part of the CI and Production workflows.
  - These use secure API keys passed through GitHub Secrets and are integrated into the data pipeline for timely ingestion.
  - Database: `raw`, Schema: `raw_weather`

### Environments:
Transformed data models and raw ingested data are organized into distinct environments for a sustainable development workflow.

- **Development**
   - Database: `analytics`, Schema: `dev_[your-name]`
   - One per developer to avoid conflicts or overriding changes.

- **CI**
   - Database: `analytics`, Schema: `ci`
   - An isolated schema for validating Pull Request changes.
   - **Automated workflow job sequence:**
     1. Load data using Fivetran
     2. Ingest external API data via Python script
     3. Run dbt build and test to validate models on data ingested using Fivetran

- **Production**
   - Database: `analytics`, Schemas: 
     - `staging`
     - `warehouse`
     - `marts`
   - **Automated workflow job sequence:**
     1. Load data using Fivetran
     2. Ingest external Weatherstack API data via Python script
     3. Run dbt transformations and tests on data ingested using Fivetran

### How to Get Started?
1. **Set up your local development environment**
   - Use your preferred IDE (e.g. VS Code), dbt Cloud, or GitHub Codespaces
2. **Clone the current repo (or create a new one)**
   - Checkout the `main` branch and run `git pull` to sync changes
3. **Create a new branch for your changes**
   - `git branch your_branch_name` then `git checkout your_branch_name`
4. **Start developing**
   - Follow team conventions and [Style Guide](_project_docs/style_guide.md)
5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your branch and request review
   - CI workflow will run the full job sequence:
     - Fivetran sync
     - API data ingestion
     - dbt build and tests
6. **Merge to `main`**
   - Post-merge, Production workflow will run the same job sequence
7. **Pull latest updates**
   - `git checkout main` then `git pull`
8. **Repeat the cycle**

### Notes
- **API Secrets & Credentials**: Stored securely using GitHub Secrets and injected into CI/CD workflows.
- **Fivetran Configs**: Fivetran connectors are configured through the GitHub Secrets and called during automation workflows to run Fivetran steps.
