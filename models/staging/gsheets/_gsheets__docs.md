{% docs stg_gsheets__franchise_actives_description %}
A breakdown of active franchise metadata sourced from the `franchise_actives` sheet in Google Storage.

This model is structured with a `game`-level grain and built for reusability in downstream aggregations. While it supports rollups by various dimensions (date, team, coach, etc.), access to individual-level details is retained to enable flexible slicing.

The data includes (but is not limited to):
* Total games played
* Home and away team scores
* Point differentials
* Home vs away win outcomes

It also contains core franchise metadata such as:
* Team Names
* Head Coaches
* General Managers
* Day Info (Date, Weekday, Month)
* Game Status (Regulation, Overtime)
